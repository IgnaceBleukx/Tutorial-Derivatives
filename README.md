This repository contains the code and runnable notebook for the Explainable Constraint Solving tutorial at the CP2023 conference.

Explainable constraint solving is a sub-field of explainable AI (XAI) concerned with explaining constraint (optimization) problems. 
Although constraint models are explicit: they are written down in terms of individual constraints that need to be satisfied, and the solution to such models can be non-trivial to understand.

Driven by the use-case of nurse scheduling, we demonstrate the type of questions a user can have about (non)-solutions, as well as reviewing what kind of computational tools are available today to answer such questions. 
We cover classical methods such as MUS/MCS extraction, and more recent advances in the field such as step-wise explanations, constraint relaxation methods, and counterfactual solutions.
We demonstrate and give special attention to techniques that we have successfully (re-)implemented on top of the CPMpy constraint-solving library, which can be readily used today.

## Just browsing?

We uploaded the executed version of the slides in both `.pdf` and `.html` versions.

The slide-show can be run from browser by opening the `.html` version and using `Space` to go to the next slide, or by going to the following link:

## How to run?

To run the `.ipynb` yourself, makes sure you install the following packages:
- CPMpy (>= v0.9.17)
- jupyter
- rise (to make the slideshow)
- faker (to create fake names for nurses)
- pandas (for visualizations)
- matplotlib (for visualizations)

A one-liner to install pip-packages:

```bash
pip install cpmpy jupyter nbclassic rise faker pandas matplotlib
```

Optionally, you can install the `Gurobi` MIP solver and the `Exact` ILP solver for better performance of algorithms relying on incremental solving:
Note that for Gurobi, you will need a license in order to make full use of its power.

```bash
pip install gurobipy exact
```
